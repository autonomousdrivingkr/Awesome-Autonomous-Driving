The scenes of 20 second length are manually selected to show a diverse and interesting set of driving maneuvers, traffic situations and unexpected behaviors. The rich complexity of nuScenes will encourage development of methods that enable safe driving in urban areas with dozens of objects per scene. Gathering data on different continents further allows us to study the generalization of computer vision algorithms across different locations, weather conditions, vehicle types, vegetation, road markings and left versus right hand traffic.

Our first contribution is the design and implementation of a scalable annotation system that can provide a comprehensive set of image labels for large-scale driving datasets. Our second contribution is a new driving dataset, facilitated by our tooling, which is an order of magnitude larger than previous efforts, and is comprised of over 100K videos with diverse kinds of annotations including image level tagging, object bounding boxes, drivable areas, lane markings, and full-frame instance segmentation. The dataset possesses geographic, environmental, and weather diversity, which is useful for training models so that they are less likely to be surprised by new conditions.

## Software
### ROS
* ROS:he Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it's all open source. [[Web](http://www.ros.org/)]
